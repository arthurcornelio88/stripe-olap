# üìä Fact Table Design: `fact_invoices`

This document outlines the design and construction logic behind the `fact_invoices` table in our OLAP schema, which is derived from the normalized Stripe data originally stored in a JSON OLTP format.

---

## üîç Purpose

The `fact_invoices` table serves as the **central fact table** in our data warehouse. Each row represents **a single invoice** issued to a customer, enriched with related contextual data.

This table enables analytical queries such as:
- Revenue by product, customer, plan, or period
- Invoice volume trends
- Conversion or churn rates
- Aggregates across plans or cohorts

## üèóÔ∏è Source Tables

The table is built by merging and transforming data from:

| Source Table        | Usage                                                             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `invoices`          | Base of the fact table (one row = one invoice)                    |
| `customers`         | Enriches customer details (email, country, delinquent, etc.)      |
| `subscriptions`     | Plan and billing metadata (linked via `subscription_id`)          |
| `products`          | Name, description of the purchased product                        |
| `prices`            | Price amount, currency, interval, billing scheme, etc.            |
| `payment_methods`   | Type of payment (card, etc.), funding source, etc.                |

## üß† Design Considerations

* ‚úÖ All joins are **1-to-1 or 1-to-N**, ensuring referential integrity.
* ‚úÖ We normalize nested fields (e.g. invoice lines, subscription items) to get granular data.
* ‚úÖ Enriched dimensions allow grouping, filtering and slicing metrics by multiple axes.

### ‚ùì Why `payment_intents` and `charges` Are Not Included (Yet)

While `payment_intents` and `charges` contain critical payment lifecycle data (authorization, capture, and payment outcomes), they are **not directly embedded** in this version of the `fact_invoices` table for the following reasons:

* üîÑ **Decoupling of Payment Events**: Stripe‚Äôs `invoice ‚Üí payment_intent ‚Üí charge` chain is *asynchronous*. Not every invoice has a 1-to-1 relationship with a final charge ‚Äî making it complex to ensure accurate joins without risking duplicate or partial data.

* üìÑ **Separation of Concerns**: The current goal of `fact_invoices` is to serve **billing-level analytics**, centered around issued and finalized invoices. Including payment event granularity would mix behavioral and financial layers.

* üîç **Optional Enrichment**: Payment intent metadata (e.g., `receipt_email`, `payment_method_details`) can be joined externally when needed for deeper fraud/risk analysis ‚Äî or used to build a future `fact_payments` table.

A future iteration may include these fields once we finalize a clear, idempotent mapping logic. Until then, this separation keeps the invoice logic lean and auditable.
