# üìä Fact Table Design: `fact_invoices`

This document outlines the design and construction logic behind the `fact_invoices` table in our OLAP schema, which is derived from the normalized Stripe data originally stored in a JSON OLTP format.

---

## üîç Purpose

The `fact_invoices` table serves as the **central fact table** in our data warehouse. Each row represents **a single invoice** issued to a customer, enriched with related contextual data.

This table enables analytical queries such as:
- Revenue by product, customer, plan, or period
- Invoice volume trends
- Conversion or churn rates
- Aggregates across plans or cohorts

## üèóÔ∏è Source Tables

The table is built by merging and transforming data from:

| Source Table        | Usage                                                             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `invoices`          | Base of the fact table (one row = one invoice)                    |
| `customers`         | Enriches customer details (email, country, delinquent, etc.)      |
| `subscriptions`     | Plan and billing metadata (linked via `subscription_id`)          |
| `products`          | Name, description of the purchased product                        |
| `prices`            | Price amount, currency, interval, billing scheme, etc.            |
| `payment_methods`   | Type of payment (card, etc.), funding source, etc.                |

## üß† Design Considerations

* ‚úÖ All joins are **1-to-1 or 1-to-N**, ensuring referential integrity.
* ‚úÖ We normalize nested fields (e.g. invoice lines, subscription items) to get granular data.
* ‚úÖ Enriched dimensions allow grouping, filtering and slicing metrics by multiple axes.

---

### ‚úÖ Why `payment_intents` and `charges` Are Now Included Separately

While `payment_intents` and `charges` are crucial to understanding the Stripe payment lifecycle (`invoice ‚Üí payment_intent ‚Üí charge`), they are intentionally **not embedded inside `fact_invoices`**, but instead exposed via their own dimension tables:

- `dim_payment_intents`
- `dim_charges`

This design reflects the following principles:

* üîÑ **Asynchronous Events**  
  Payment objects evolve independently ‚Äî some invoices are finalized before any payment intent is confirmed or captured.

* üìÑ **Separation of Concerns**  
  `fact_invoices` focuses on **invoice-level** logic (billing intent), while payment events (auth, success, failure) are treated in **dedicated tables** to avoid mixing layers.

* üîç **Joinability When Needed**  
  Fields like `status`, `receipt_email`, or fraud metadata from charges can be joined externally using `payment_intent_id`, allowing fraud/risk pipelines or reconciliation logic to plug in easily.

This modular structure keeps `fact_invoices` clean and auditable, while providing all raw material needed for deeper payment insights.
